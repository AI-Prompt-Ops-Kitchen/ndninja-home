# Prompt Toolkit — Business Plan

## Executive Summary

The Prompt Toolkit is a structured system for writing better AI prompts — originally built in Notion by a neurodivergent creator who uses AI daily, now migrated to PostgreSQL and ready for commercialization as a cross-platform SaaS (iOS, Android, web).

The prompt engineering market is valued at ~$500M in 2025 and projected to reach $6.7B by 2034 (33% CAGR). Current competitors are either **marketplaces** (selling individual prompts) or **browser extensions** (bolted onto ChatGPT). Nobody owns the "prompt workbench" category — a dedicated tool that helps you *build* better prompts rather than just *buy* them.

That's the gap. That's the product.

## 1. Market Positioning & Competitive Analysis

### The Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Model | Pricing | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PromptBase** | Marketplace (buy/sell prompts) | $2.99-$4.99 per prompt | Transactional, no learning curve help. You buy fish, never learn to fish. |
| **FlowGPT** | Community platform + marketplace | Freemium, $10M VC-funded | Social-first, not tool-first. Discovery overload. Prompt quality inconsistent. |
| **AIPRM** | Chrome extension for ChatGPT/Claude | $10-$999/mo (Plus→Titan) | Locked to browser. Extension fatigue. Hostile pricing page ("no discounts, no refunds"). |
| **SnackPrompt** | Bite-sized prompt library | Free/community | Quantity over quality. No structure or methodology. |
| **God of Prompt** | Prompt bundles/courses | One-time $49-$199 | Static content. No tool, just PDFs and Notion templates. |
| **PromptPerfect** | AI-powered prompt optimizer | Subscription | Black box — optimizes prompts but doesn't teach you *why*. |

### Where Everyone Else Gets It Wrong

1. **Marketplaces sell fish.** PromptBase, FlowGPT — they give you someone else's prompt. It works until the AI model updates, and then it doesn't. No transferable skill.
2. **Extensions are duct tape.** AIPRM lives inside ChatGPT's UI. If OpenAI changes their layout (they do, constantly), the extension breaks.
3. **Nobody teaches the craft.** There's no "Figma for prompts" — a dedicated workspace where you build, iterate, test, and refine prompts using proven frameworks.

### Our Differentiator: "Teach to Fish" + Authentic Voice

**The Prompt Toolkit is a prompt IDE, not a prompt store.**

- **Framework-driven**: Built on actual prompting methodologies (RICE, Chain-of-Thought, Role-Task-Format, etc.), not random community submissions
- **Model-agnostic**: Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, whatever comes next — because it's about *how* you prompt, not *where*
- **Built by a practitioner**: The creator is neurodivergent (ADHD + Autism), uses AI every single day, and built this for themselves first. Every feature exists because it solved a real problem.
- **Cross-platform native**: Not a Chrome extension. A real app — iOS, Android, web — that goes where you go.

### Brand Positioning Statement

> *"Built by someone who actually uses AI. Not by a VC pitch deck."*

The neurodivergent creator angle isn't a gimmick — it's the product thesis. People with ADHD/Autism often develop systems and frameworks to manage complexity. This toolkit IS that system, externalized and productized. Authenticity is the moat.

## 2. Pricing Tiers

### Tier Structure

| Feature | **Free** | **Pro** ($9/mo or $79/yr) | **Team** ($19/user/mo) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prompt frameworks library | 5 core frameworks | All frameworks + custom | All + team-shared |
| Saved prompts | 25 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Prompt history/versioning | Last 10 | Full history | Full + team audit trail |
| AI model integrations | ChatGPT only | All supported models | All + SSO + admin |
| Prompt templates | Community only | Community + Premium | Community + Premium + Private team library |
| Export/share | Copy to clipboard | Export as markdown/JSON, share links | All + team workspace, shared collections |
| Prompt scoring/analysis | Basic tips | Full analysis + optimization suggestions | All + team performance analytics |
| Priority support | Community forum | Email within 24h | Dedicated + onboarding call |
| Offline access | No | Yes (mobile apps) | Yes |

### Why $9/mo

- **Below AIPRM Plus** ($10/mo) — positioned as the better-value alternative
- **Below most SaaS fatigue thresholds** — people cancel $15-25 tools, they keep $9 ones
- **Annual discount meaningful** ($79/yr = $6.58/mo) — rewards commitment without feeling like a trap
- **Psychological anchor**: "Less than two coffees a month"

### Enterprise / Custom

Not a published tier. If companies with 50+ seats come knocking, custom pricing starts at $15/user/mo with volume discounts, SSO, admin dashboards, and dedicated onboarding. But don't build this until someone asks for it.

---

## 3. Monetization Strategy

### Primary: Freemium → Subscription

The free tier is genuinely useful — 5 frameworks and 25 saved prompts is enough to hook someone. The paywall kicks in when they want:
- More frameworks (they'll want them all)
- Unlimited saves (25 fills up in a week for power users)
- Multi-model support (Claude users can't stay on free forever)
- History/versioning (once you lose a great prompt, you never want that again)

### Secondary Revenue Streams (Phase 2+)

| Stream | Timing | Revenue Potential |
|---|---|---|
| **Premium template packs** | Month 3+ | $3-7 per pack, impulse buys |
| **Creator marketplace** (users sell templates) | Month 6+ | 20-30% commission on sales |
| **API access** | Month 6+ | Usage-based for developers integrating prompt tooling |
| **Courses/workshops** | Month 4+ | $29-49 per course, builds authority |
| **Prompt audit service** | Month 6+ | $99-299 per audit, high-touch |

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ **Credits/tokens**: Creates anxiety. People hate counting. Subscription is predictable.
- ❌ **Per-prompt pricing**: Feels punitive. PromptBase's model doesn't build loyalty.
- ❌ **Lifetime deals**: Tempting for launch cash but destroys LTV. AppSumo graveyard is full of these.
- ❌ **Ads**: Kills trust. If the product is about focus and productivity, ads are antithetical.

## 4. Revenue Projections

### Conservative Model (Bootstrapped, Solo/Small Team)

Assumptions:
- 5% free→paid conversion (industry standard for freemium is 2-5%)
- $9/mo average revenue per paid user (blend of monthly + annual)
- 3% monthly churn on paid users
- Organic growth + targeted marketing, no paid ads initially

| Milestone | Total Users | Paid Users (5%) | MRR | ARR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Month 3 | 500 | 25 | $225 | $2,700 |
| Month 6 | 2,000 | 100 | $900 | $10,800 |
| Month 12 | 5,000 | 250 | $2,250 | $27,000 |
| Month 18 | 12,000 | 600 | $5,400 | $64,800 |
| Month 24 | 25,000 | 1,250 | $11,250 | $135,000 |
| Month 36 | 50,000 | 2,500 | $22,500 | $270,000 |

### Optimistic Model (Viral Content Hit + Product-Led Growth)

Same structure but with 8% conversion and faster user acquisition:

| Milestone | Total Users | Paid Users (8%) | MRR | ARR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Month 6 | 5,000 | 400 | $3,600 | $43,200 |
| Month 12 | 15,000 | 1,200 | $10,800 | $129,600 |
| Month 24 | 50,000 | 4,000 | $36,000 | $432,000 |

### Revenue Reality Check

- **Ramen profitable** (~$2-3K MRR): Achievable by month 6-9
- **Full-time viable** (~$5-8K MRR): Achievable by month 12-18
- **Real business** ($10K+ MRR): Month 18-24

With secondary revenue streams (template packs, marketplace commission, courses), add 20-40% on top of subscription revenue by month 12+.

### Cost Structure (Estimated Monthly)

| Cost | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hosting (PostgreSQL + API) | $50-200 | Scales with users |
| App Store fees | 15-30% of mobile revenue | Apple/Google take their cut |
| Domain + SSL + CDN | $20 | Cloudflare |
| Email/transactional | $20-50 | Postmark or similar |
| AI API costs (if offering prompt testing) | $100-500 | Pass-through or absorb in Pro tier |
| Total baseline | ~$200-800/mo | Very lean for a SaaS |

## 5. Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 0: Pre-Launch (Weeks 1-4)

**Build the waitlist before the product.**

1. **Landing page** with clear value prop + email capture
   - Headline: "Stop guessing at prompts. Start engineering them."
   - Show before/after: bad prompt → framework-applied prompt → dramatically better output
2. **Social proof via content**:
   - Twitter/X thread: "I'm neurodivergent and I built a system for AI prompts. Here's what I learned." (authenticity play)
   - Reddit posts in r/ChatGPT, r/artificial, r/PromptEngineering, r/neurodiversity
   - YouTube/TikTok: Show the toolkit in action — real-time prompt building
3. **Personal brand as founder**:
   - "Build in public" — share the journey, the PostgreSQL migration, the decisions
   - Neurodivergent creator angle resonates HARD on Twitter/TikTok right now

### Phase 1: Closed Beta (Weeks 4-8)

- Invite 50-100 users from waitlist
- Focus on **web app only** (fastest to iterate)
- Collect feedback aggressively — what frameworks do they use most? Where do they get stuck?
- Build 10-15 case studies: "User X improved their [task] prompts by [metric]"

### Phase 2: Public Launch (Weeks 8-12)

**Launch simultaneously on:**

| Channel | Strategy |
|---|---|
| **Product Hunt** | Coordinate upvotes, prepare Show HN-quality description. Target Tuesday/Wednesday launch. |
| **Hacker News** | "Show HN: I built a prompt engineering workbench" — lean into the technical angle |
| **Twitter/X** | Thread: "I just launched the thing. Here's the whole story." |
| **Reddit** | r/SideProject, r/ChatGPT, r/Entrepreneur, r/ADHD (authenticity angle) |
| **IndieHackers** | Detailed build-in-public post with real numbers |
| **YouTube** | Partner with 3-5 AI/productivity YouTubers for reviews |

### Phase 3: Growth Engine (Months 3-12)

**Content marketing is the primary growth lever:**

1. **SEO content**: "How to write better prompts for [specific task]" — 50+ articles targeting long-tail keywords
2. **Free tools**: Prompt grader, framework quiz — lead magnets that drive signups
3. **Community**: Discord or Circle community for prompt enthusiasts
4. **Partnerships**: Integrate with popular AI tools, co-market with complementary products
5. **Referral program**: Give Pro users a way to invite friends (both get 1 month free)

### Getting the First 1,000 Users

| Source | Estimated Users | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Product Hunt launch | 200-500 | Free |
| Twitter/X content | 100-300 | Free (time investment) |
| Reddit posts | 50-150 | Free |
| YouTube reviews (gifted Pro accounts) | 100-200 | ~$500 in gifted subs |
| IndieHackers/HN | 50-100 | Free |
| Personal network + beta users | 50-100 | Free |
| **Total** | **550-1,350** | **~$500** |

The first 1,000 users should be achievable within 6-8 weeks of public launch with zero paid advertising.

## 6. Retention Hooks

### Why People Stay

| Hook | Mechanism | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| **Prompt library lock-in** | Your saved prompts, history, and iterations live in the app. Switching costs increase over time. | All |
| **Framework discovery** | Release new frameworks monthly. Pro users get them first. Creates FOMO + anticipation. | Pro |
| **Streak/progress system** | "You've engineered 47 prompts this month" — gamification without being obnoxious | All |
| **Version history** | "Remember that perfect prompt from 3 weeks ago?" You can't get that back without us. | Pro |
| **Community templates** | User-generated templates keep the content fresh without you doing the work | All |
| **Model update alerts** | "GPT-5 just dropped. Here's how your frameworks adapt." — timely, high-value content | Pro |
| **Weekly prompt digest** | Email: "Top 5 prompts of the week + 1 new framework" — keeps you in their inbox | All |

### The Habit Loop

```
Trigger: User needs to use AI for a task
  → Action: Opens Prompt Toolkit, selects framework
    → Reward: Dramatically better AI output
      → Investment: Saves prompt, builds library
        → Trigger strengthens: Next time, opens Toolkit first
```

### Reducing Churn

1. **Onboarding flow**: First 7 days are critical. Guide users through building their first 3 prompts using frameworks. Show the before/after.
2. **"Win" emails**: "Your prompt got 50 upvotes" or "You've saved 2+ hours this week" — quantify the value
3. **Rescue flow**: When someone cancels, show them their library size and offer a pause (1 month free) instead of cancel
4. **Annual incentive**: Make annual pricing genuinely better ($79 vs $108) — annual users churn at 1/3 the rate of monthly

## 7. The Neurodivergent Advantage

This isn't a diversity checkbox — it's the core product thesis.

### Why It Matters for the Product

- **Systems thinking**: ND creators build frameworks because they NEED structure to manage cognitive load. That's exactly what this product delivers.
- **Hyperfocus-tested**: If the creator used this for hundreds of hours, it's been stress-tested in ways a PM with a sprint board never achieves.
- **Accessibility-first**: An ND creator naturally builds for clarity, reducing cognitive overhead, clear next steps — things that benefit ALL users.

### Why It Matters for Marketing

- **Authenticity is currency**: In 2025, consumers (especially Gen Z and millennials) can smell corporate inauthenticity instantly. "Made by someone who needs this" > "Made by a growth team."
- **Community identification**: The ND community (~15-20% of the population) actively supports ND creators. This is a built-in audience.
- **Storytelling**: "I built this because my brain works differently, and AI is the best tool I've ever had — but only if you know how to talk to it." That's a story people share.

### Brand Voice Guidelines

- **Honest, not corporate**: "This works because I tested it 500 times" not "Leverage enterprise-grade prompt optimization"
- **Direct**: Get to the point. No filler. ND users especially appreciate this.
- **Self-aware humor**: Acknowledge the meta-irony of using AI to build a tool about using AI better
- **Show, don't claim**: Demo videos > feature lists. Before/after > bullet points.

## 8. Strategic Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **AI models get so good prompting doesn't matter** | Medium (2-3 years) | Pivot to "AI workflow builder" — the framework thinking transfers beyond prompting |
| **Big player enters (OpenAI builds this in)** | Medium | Stay model-agnostic. If OpenAI builds it, it only works with ChatGPT. We work with everything. |
| **App Store rejection/policy changes** | Low | Web app is the core product. Mobile apps are distribution, not the platform. |
| **Creator burnout (solo founder)** | High | Build recurring revenue fast. Hire first contractor by $5K MRR. Automate content pipeline. |
| **Low conversion rate (<2%)** | Medium | A/B test paywall triggers. Add value to Pro tier. Consider $7/mo price test. |

---

## 9. Milestones & Decision Points

| Timeline | Milestone | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| **Month 0** | Landing page + waitlist | If <200 signups in 2 weeks, revisit positioning |
| **Month 2** | Beta launch (web) | If retention <30% after 30 days, rethink core value prop |
| **Month 3** | Public launch | If <500 users after launch week, double down on content marketing |
| **Month 4** | First $1K MRR | If conversion <2%, test pricing and paywall placement |
| **Month 6** | Mobile app launch | If web metrics are strong; don't build mobile too early |
| **Month 9** | $5K MRR | Hire first contractor (content or engineering) |
| **Month 12** | Marketplace launch | Only if community is active enough to sustain it |
| **Month 18** | $10K MRR target | Evaluate: keep bootstrapped or explore strategic funding? |
