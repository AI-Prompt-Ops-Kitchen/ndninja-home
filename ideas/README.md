# 💡 Idea Catcher

Clawd captures ideas here whenever Ninja shares them.

## How it works
- Text Clawd any idea, anytime
- Clawd saves it with timestamp and any relevant tags
- Ideas are stored in monthly files: `YYYY-MM.md`
- Periodic reviews surface forgotten gems

## Tags
- 🔥 Hot — actively excited about this
- 💤 Backburner — cool but not now
- 🚀 Project — could become a real project
- 💡 Spark — raw thought, needs development
- 🔧 Improvement — enhancement to existing thing
