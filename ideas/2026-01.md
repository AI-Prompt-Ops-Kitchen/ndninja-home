### 💡 Recipe Collection Library

Personal recipe collection web app for home use. Considering an iPhone app too but unsure if the dev effort is worth it for mobile.

**Features brainstormed:**
- Paste a URL → auto-import recipe (scrape title, ingredients, steps, photo)
- Generate a shopping list from selected recipes
- PWA so it works as an iPhone app without App Store

**Clawd's notes:** PWA is the move — one codebase, installs on iPhone like native. PostgreSQL backend, naturally. Recipe scraping is very doable (most recipe sites use structured schema.org/Recipe markup). Shopping list could merge duplicate ingredients across multiple recipes and group by aisle. 🐾
