- I noticed that the various poses have more of a Chibi style short and stocky body that doesn't really fit the Pixar art direction.  Are you able to see what I am refering to?  I th…

- 4 seconds seems very short to me especially for a talking head style video don't yhou think?  Even 6 seconds seems short to me.  Let's target 10 seconds and see how that feels.  Ho…

- I think I want to keep it simple to start.  Non-negotiable items are previews that load into the dashboard when they are ready for my review.  The ability to upload files easily to…
- commit this because it is a slight improvement but that is still going to cause me problems.  Can we design some kind of work around?  The problem is links like the tailscale IP on…
