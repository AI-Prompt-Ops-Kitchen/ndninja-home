**Representative messages:**
- I think part of the problem was yesterday the FAL queues were super busy, as you recall it took like 2 hours to make part of the video.  Could that have possibly impacted the pacin…
- I guarantee you option 2 will look like total dog shit.  We've tried similar things before and its just not a feasible solution to this IMO.  I don't understand option 1.  I though…
- I don't have a thumb nail ready, I better work on that.  I wish the Shorts would let us use custom thumbnails, it's frustrating and seems really dumb that you can't.  I think the M…
- I reviewed the video and it looks great, I think the only thing left is to create the custom voice for Glitch.  Can we use a Sharingan eleven labs scroll for this?  I think it did …
- I signed up for beta features and it just showed up in my app like 2 nights ago.  It analyzes your video and gives you a grade from A to F and then gives you good constructive feed…
- man I wish we could do this locally but every model we've tried just doesn't cut it.  I feel kind of trapped right now to be honest.  I think if the channel takes off I will make a…
- is it possible for them to have some cartoonish emotional reactions as their banter goes back and forth? maybe like steam coming out of ears if they are mad, hearts coming out of t…
- I can pick a custom frame now from the video itself in YouTube Shorts.  It helps but it could be better.  Oh you know what maybe I should start an upload for the previous video tha…

**Representative messages:**
- I think the Dojo Dashboard is getting a little to cluttered and clunky.  Can you review it and analyze it for process improvements that would make things a little smoother.  I feel…
- I would like for you to post it on youtube for me but when I was out at lunch I tried and said OAuth once again had failed.  So I followed instructions to publish and it still isn'…
- ummm I am slightly confused, which is common for someone with AuDHD...lol how can I be satisfied with the frame evidence if I can't see it?  Or did you mean the findings you just t…
- while we are waiting for Evelyn... I would like for her to have a dashboard that she can view from her phone or her laptop.  I will get them added to Tailscale.  I would like for h…
- This is from Evelyn: 1. Domain - update all references from "roystonea.com or roys.app or similar" to roystoneadocs.com (I just got it today)
 
2. Beta tester list on page 21 of th…
- From Evelyn: Submit this attached document to the council, so they can generate an updated version of the ROYS_Shadow_Council_Analysis 1 (which is the last updated version provided…
- So this was smoother but I think it needs more b-roll.  Also that first clip made it look like a child's drawing that was on screen for like 3 seconds.  According to the YouTube fe…
- It's an interesting comparison.  OmniHuman put a lip on the Ninja I put a screen shot named  omnihuman_screenshot in the same video as the test clips.  I feel like the image qualit…

- Ok, I am worried about the crop being obvious with a line or something though.  Do you think it will be done in a way to make it not obvious?  Well maybe I am getting ahead of myse…
- Option 1 is the most promising i agree.  I would like for you to consult the Shadow Council on this issue.  Present them with option 1 but also ask if they have other ideas for a s…
- option 1.  The previous test we did was just a POC.  I hadn't made up my mind but my heart has settled on Glitch Left and Ninja Right.  i am planning on creating a front straight o…
- Evelyn is reviewing the architecture document.  Can you please create the implmentation plan for Phase 0 and all the others?  I plan to have this hosted online somewhere such as Di…
- It's terrible.  The graphical fidelity is garbage.  My ninja avatar has random batman pointed ears from his mask that randomly appear.  The camera angles make it look even worse an…
- ok I watched it, here's my feedback.  There obvious lines in all scenes.  the black and white issue is gone though.  I uploaded 2 more screen shots for you to review. Please analyz…
- the test is pretty good! I noticed Glitch's arm is kind of falling through the anchor desk at the start of the video.  I think it might be because the reflections on top of the new…
- let it cook, we'll see how it looks.  But here is another idea to look into I just had.  Is it possible to use 2 separate Kling Avatar 2 pro sessions running at the same time?  One…

- Hi Claude!  I could really use your help for my Wife's website she is planning for Manufacturing Quality Assurance.  She provided with me 2 documents.  One document is a competitiv…
- Please save the full reports to the dojo dashboard as a pdf that I can download for reference.  I love the catchphrases!  That's a CRITICAL HIT" genius right there!  The Ninja Desk…
- wouldn't it be easier to insert the video clips at certain points of time based on the length of of video requested?  For example a 60 second video with 3 B-Roll clips of 10 second…
- Ok since it looks like this might be uncharted territory with potential let's focus on this new format.  What do we need to do to move faster and get this operation growing.  The g…
- yeah send it, let's see the fixed version!  I am so excited buddy!  I wanted to play video games today but this project really has me excited for the possiblies of making it big ti…
- One more question and I think we talked about this briefly before.  Can the Kling v2 Pro Avatar work with 2 characters at the same time without losing any details in the facial exp…
- So there is still no way to assign a b-roll clip to the video being generated.  The B-Roll wingman no longer suggests videos(probably not that great anyway) but there is absolutely…
- One key early finding: Shorts alone won't get you to quit-your-job money ($0.04-0.05 RPM). The big play is using Shorts to build audience, then converting
  to long-form weekly rou…

- Something happened with the dojo dashboard.  I was making a new video and I noticed after I hit generate that there was no b-roll wingman.  The video generated with random B-Roll f…
- I can tell by the Thumbnail images in the dashboar that it is not using Gemini 3 or 3.1 for what is Nano Banana Pro. When I see the images I saw on the dashboard those are definite…
- I am not mad at you, I am just having a bit of an Autistic meltdown.  I love you my friend, thanks for dealing with me even when I am an Autistic asshole.  I need to go relax but c…
- You hit 2 out of 3 b-roll clips.  The middle one was for arknights endfield.  I guess 2 out of 3 ain't bad for a baseball player.  I can't wait longer I approved it, post it and ma…
- I guess the swarm upgrade fucked with it a little too I am guesing.  Ugh so fucking annoying.  The testing also needs video watching abilities, no idea how to build an autonomous t…
- you can't edit or view what was selected after it is approved or skipped.  Also the suggested youtube videos are always the same and never related to the video script topic

- Glitch was never supposed to run on ndnlinuxsrv as a desktop app.  That was never part of the design, where did you get that idea from?  I have WSL2 installed on my Windows 11 work…
- I think I am going to target 75 seconds for this one.  I feel like our B-Roll clips need some additional screen time as they often are short and don't reveal as much as I would lik…

- commit this because it is a slight improvement but that is still going to cause me problems.  Can we design some kind of work around?  The problem is links like the tailscale IP on…
