## Council Overview

The same five council members reconvened to assess Evelyn's decisions against the original analysis. This update reflects a founder who reviewed the council's work thoroughly, accepted what aligned with her expertise and market knowledge, pushed back where the council was wrong, and added strategic elements the council missed entirely.

| Council Member | Focus Area |
|---|---|
| **SaaS Business Strategist** | Pricing economics, subscription model, competitive moat |
| **Regulatory Affairs & Quality Systems Expert** | Content credibility, tier structure, regulatory risks |
| **Product & Technology Architect** | Custom stack assessment, MVP scope, technical risks |
| **B2B Marketing & GTM Specialist** | Go-to-market strategy, positioning, channel approach |
| **Business Risk & Financial Analyst** | Unit economics, revenue projections, go/no-go criteria |

**Overall Assessment: Evelyn has made disciplined, well-reasoned decisions that correct several assumptions the original analysis got wrong — particularly around target customer (established orgs, not startups), build approach (custom stack, not Bubble.io), and pricing psychology (volume play, not premium signaling). The strategic foundation is significantly stronger than what we originally proposed.**

---

## What Changed

### Resolved Since v1
- **Pricing & tiers:** Two content tiers (Core/Enhanced), four purchase types, consulting add-on, overage pricing — all defined
- **Build approach:** Custom stack (Python/FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL) built by husband Jeramie using Claude Code. Bubble.io eliminated.
- **Technical docs:** Architecture and Implementation Plan completed. Phase 0 scaffolding (database, models, API, frontend shell) already built.
- **Consulting add-on:** Adopted as core feature with defined scope and pricing
- **Brand name:** Roystonea Documents (domain: roystoneadocs.com)

### Key Corrections to Council Recommendations
- **Target market:** Established organizations (labs, CROs, CMOs, pharma), not pre-submission startups
- **QMSR timing:** Deadline already passed Feb 2, 2026 — remediation angle, not urgency campaign
- **MDSAP expansion:** Requires TGA/PMDA/ANVISA/Health Canada buildout — strategic expansion, not quick win (council was wrong)
- **88% coverage figure:** Flawed math — 539 is total mappings, not unique requirements covered (council was wrong)
- **Marketing intensity:** 1 post/week, defer ROYS-specific marketing until 4-6 weeks before launch
- **Consultant partner program:** Skip formal program at launch

### Items Removed from Scope
AI content polishing, PDF export, gap analysis view, user dashboard, white-label for consultants, document numbering scheme, terminology substitutions, "Applies To" UI filter, investigation documentation

## Synthesized Key Findings (Updated)

### What the Council Now Unanimously Agrees On

1. **The content library remains the core IP.** 610 requirements, 539 mappings, 567 content blocks, 81 SOPs. This has not changed and is the foundation everything else builds on.

2. **Traceability mapping is still the killer differentiator.** The tier split between reference-level (Core) and full traceability matrix (Enhanced) is a sound way to monetize this advantage. No competitor offers this at any tier.

3. **The custom build is the right long-term decision.** Eliminating Bubble.io removes vendor lock-in, platform cost, and the inevitable migration pain. With a capable builder using Claude Code, the 14-18 week timeline is acceptable.

4. **The consulting add-on is the strongest strategic addition.** The council undervalued the consulting-to-software pipeline. Evelyn's dual revenue model (software + consulting) hedges risk and creates a natural trust-building loop.

5. **Pricing is lower than we recommended but internally consistent.** The Planet Fitness psychology — low enough to not cancel, below purchasing thresholds, 3:1 single-to-sub ratio — is a coherent strategy. The volume requirements are higher, but the near-zero infrastructure cost makes this viable.

6. **Risk-based content as baseline is correct.** The regulatory expert's original recommendation to make this baseline (not premium) has been adopted. Modern standards require it. An SOP without risk elements signals amateur authorship.

7. **The QMSR update is a launch blocker, not a post-launch patch.** Every 21 CFR 820 SOP must reflect QMSR alignment before the first sale. This is non-negotiable.

### Where the Council Still Sees Risk

| Risk | Severity | Flagged By |
|---|---|---|
| Launch catalog size may be too small for subscriptions | High | SaaS Strategist |
| Content matrix completeness for all combo keys | High | Product Architect |
| Customer acquisition cost at lower price points | Medium | Risk Analyst |
| Subscription conversion ratio uncertainty | Medium | Risk Analyst, SaaS Strategist |
| 14-18 weeks of zero revenue during build | Medium | SaaS Strategist |
| Time allocation drift (10 hrs/week constraint) | Medium | Risk Analyst |
| Mini-FMEA appendix liability if poorly scoped | Low | Regulatory Expert |

---

## 1. SaaS Business Strategist

### Pricing Assessment: The Planet Fitness Play

Evelyn's pricing logic is sound and internally consistent. The $49/$75 single SOP entry point eliminates purchase friction entirely — this sits below virtually every corporate procurement threshold and makes impulse buying trivial. The 3:1 single-to-subscription ratio ($49 single vs. $79/mo for 5 SOPs, effectively $15.80/each) creates a strong economic pull toward subscriptions once a buyer validates quality with their first purchase.

Where the council pushed for $149+ per SOP, the math can still work at her price points — but the volume requirements change dramatically. At $79/mo Individual Core, she needs roughly 40 active subscribers to hit $3,160/mo MRR (compared to ~15 subscribers at the price range originally proposed). This is achievable in regulated industries where a single mid-size CRO might have 5-10 individual buyers, but it means the margin for error on customer acquisition is thinner.

The real win in this structure is the Team tier at $199-$299/mo. One Team Annual contract at $2,990 equals roughly 38 months of a single Individual Core subscription. **The entire GTM motion should be engineered to convert individual buyers into team accounts.** Every individual purchaser should be viewed as a trojan horse into their organization.

### Subscription Economics — Revised Model

Realistic 12-month targets at these prices:

- **Months 1-3 (pre/post-launch):** Primarily one-off sales, maybe 20-30 single SOPs. Revenue: ~$1,500-$2,500 total.
- **Months 4-8:** Convert early buyers to Individual subscriptions. Target 15-25 individual subs. MRR: $1,200-$3,000.
- **Months 9-12:** Land 3-5 Team accounts from organizations where individuals already bought. MRR: $2,800-$5,500.

Annual revenue range: **$30K-$55K** in year one. This is modest but profitable against a ~$30/mo infrastructure cost. The consulting add-on at $99-$199 is actually the highest-margin item in the entire catalog and could meaningfully boost revenue if even 10-15% of buyers add it.

### Go-to-Market: Custom Build Changes the Timeline

Building custom at 10 hrs/week across 14-18 weeks means launch is roughly June-July 2026. The QMSR deadline panic has passed, and the remediation angle ("you missed the deadline, now what?") actually has a longer shelf life than the compliance rush did.

The risk to flag: **14-18 weeks of building is 14-18 weeks of zero revenue.** She should strongly consider selling single SOPs as static Word documents before the platform launches. Manual fulfillment at $49-$75 per sale is absolutely worth it for early cash flow and customer validation.

### Remaining Concerns

1. **Content depth as the only moat.** The moat is Evelyn's regulatory expertise baked into the content — real but concentrated in one person.
2. **Churn at $79/month.** Planet Fitness works at $10/month because people forget. At $79, she needs ongoing value (new SOPs, regulation updates) or subscribers will buy and cancel.
3. **The consulting add-on could cannibalize subscriptions** if buyers prefer Evelyn's direct expertise over self-serve. Not necessarily bad, but it does not scale.
4. **Launch catalog size.** Set a firm minimum of 20 Core SOPs before going live with subscriptions. Sell singles before that threshold.

### Key Metric to Track

**Individual-to-team conversion rate.** That single number determines whether this is a side income or a real business.

## 2. Regulatory Affairs & Quality Systems Expert

### Tier Structure: Regulatory Credibility Assessment

The Core vs Enhanced differentiation is sound from a regulatory credibility standpoint. The critical decision — risk-based content as baseline in ALL tiers — is correct. Any quality professional who opens an SOP and finds zero risk consideration will immediately question whether the author understands the regulatory environment. Risk is not a premium feature; it is a fundamental expectation post-2015 in virtually every major quality framework.

The tier split works well in the traceability depth. A Core document that references applicable clauses gives a quality manager enough to work with. An Enhanced document with a full traceability matrix mapping specific sections to specific clauses saves them dozens of hours of cross-referencing work. That is a genuine value differential quality professionals will recognize and pay for — it is the difference between "here is what applies" and "here is exactly where in your document each requirement is addressed." The latter is what auditors actually ask for during document review.

**Caution on mini-FMEA appendix:** If included in the Enhanced tier, it must be structured as a starter framework with clear guidance that the organization must populate it with their own process-specific failure modes. Do not pre-populate risk scores — that crosses from document framework into consulting territory and creates liability. A poorly constructed FMEA template is worse than none.

### QMSR Content Readiness

Evelyn is correct that 21 CFR 820 content requires QMSR updating before launch. This is non-negotiable. The QMSR (21 CFR 820 harmonized with ISO 13485:2016) took effect February 2, 2026. Any document sold today that references the old 820 structure is immediately dated.

The practical work: every SOP referencing 820 subparts needs remapping against the new QMSR structure. Section numbering changed, terminology shifted, and explicit ISO 13485 alignment means cross-references need updating throughout. This is tedious but straightforward. It should be treated as a **launch blocker**, not a post-launch patch.

### EU MDR Exclusion

The decision to exclude EU MDR from MVP is defensible IF the marketing does not imply international regulatory coverage. EU MDR is the single most complex regulatory framework in medical device right now, and a half-built implementation would damage credibility far more than its absence. Quality professionals in the EU MDR space are sophisticated buyers who will immediately spot gaps.

The credibility risk is minimal as long as bundle naming stays honest. "Medical Device QMS Bundle" without geographic qualifiers is fine. "Comprehensive Medical Device Regulatory Bundle" without EU MDR would raise eyebrows.

### Standards vs. Regulations UI Distinction

This is a small decision with outsized credibility impact. Quality professionals are precise about this distinction, and conflating the two signals amateur understanding. ISO 13485 is a standard. 21 CFR 820 is a regulation. Getting this right in the UI earns trust before the buyer even reads a document.

### Remaining Risks

- **Content accuracy liability:** Every document needs a clear disclaimer requiring organization-specific customization. The "hardest 80% done" language helps — it implicitly communicates the remaining 20% is the buyer's responsibility.
- **Paraphrasing standards content:** ISO and ANSI actively enforce copyright. All clause references should cite rather than reproduce.
- **Version currency:** Standards and regulations update. A version date and applicable-edition reference on every document protects against claims of outdated content. Build this into document metadata from day one — retrofitting is painful.

## 3. Product & Technology Architect

### Custom Stack Decision

The pivot from Bubble.io to a custom FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL stack is fundamentally sound. The original Bubble.io recommendation optimized for speed-to-market with a non-technical founder. That constraint has been removed: Jeramie building with Claude Code changes the calculus entirely. The custom stack eliminates vendor lock-in, removes Bubble's per-workflow pricing ceiling, and gives full control over the document assembly engine — which is the core IP.

The trade-off is real: 14-18 weeks instead of 4-6. But the Bubble exit was always coming. Building custom from day one avoids the painful migration that would have consumed similar calendar time later, with the added complexity of preserving live customer data and payment state.

**Verdict:** Correct call.

### Architecture Assessment

The stack choices are mature and well-matched:

- **Async SQLAlchemy 2.0 + asyncpg:** Appropriate, though arguably over-engineered for document assembly that spends most compute in synchronous python-docx generation. The async foundation will not hurt. Run document generation in a thread pool executor if needed.
- **Alembic migrations:** Correct, non-negotiable for evolving schema.
- **JWT + bcrypt auth:** Standard and sufficient. Implement refresh token rotation. Use short-lived access tokens (15 minutes). Consider httpOnly cookies over localStorage for token storage.
- **React 19 + Tailwind v4 + TanStack Query:** Solid frontend stack. TanStack Query handles the purchase-then-generate flow well.
- **Combo key fallback strategy:** The most critical technical design. Lookup-based assembly (standard + regulation + template structure as composite key, falling back through progressively less specific keys) is deterministic and debuggable. Far preferable to AI generation for regulatory documents.

**Phase 0 scaffolding is already built** — database models, API routers, services, schemas, seeds, and Alembic migration all in place. This is genuine progress, not planning artifacts.

### MVP Feature Scope

The feature list is right-sized with one concern and one gap:

**Concern — Template Structure Selection:** This multiplies content matrix complexity. If there are 3 structures across the standards/regulations, that is many content variants to author. Confirm the content exists before building the UI. The code is cheap; the content is the bottleneck.

**Gap — Transactional email:** Registration, purchase confirmation, and download link delivery require email. Not listed in the feature set. Use Resend or SendGrid; do not self-host SMTP.

**Correctly removed:** Everything cut (document management, AI generation, gap analysis, PDF export) was weight the MVP does not need. The discipline here is strong.

### Consulting Add-On: Keep It Minimal

A form submission that writes to `consulting_requests` table and fires an email notification. A Calendly link in the confirmation email handles booking. One POST endpoint, one database table, one transactional email. Do not build scheduling, quoting, or CRM features.

### Capacity Assessment

50-100 concurrent users on a 4GB Digital Ocean droplet with FastAPI is generous headroom. Document assembly is CPU-bound but fast — a single SOP generates in under a second. Ensure generated DOCX files are streamed, not accumulated in memory. With proper streaming responses and connection pooling, this architecture handles the stated load without issue.

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Content matrix incomplete for combo keys | **High** | Validate coverage before building assembly UI. Seed scripts should fail loudly on missing keys. |
| Stripe webhook reliability | Medium | Idempotency keys + webhook event log table. Never grant access from client-side payment confirmation. |
| DOCX formatting across Word versions | Medium | Test in Word 2019, 365, and LibreOffice. Pin python-docx version. |
| Auth token management | Medium | httpOnly cookies, short-lived access tokens, refresh rotation. |
| Single-droplet availability | Low | Acceptable for MVP. Add health checks, automated restarts. Separate managed DB before scaling. |

**Bottom line:** The architecture is sound, the scope is disciplined, Phase 0 is already real code. The primary risk is not technical — it is content completeness for the assembly matrix.

## 4. B2B Marketing & Go-to-Market Specialist

### "Build First, Market Later" — Assessed

Evelyn's decision to defer marketing until 4-6 weeks before launch is unconventional but defensible. The council's original recommendation assumed available bandwidth for parallel execution. That assumption was wrong.

**Benefits:** She avoids marketing vaporware. When she does launch content, she can show the actual product, actual output quality, actual workflows. In B2B regulatory, proof beats promises. She also avoids burning her LinkedIn network's attention before she has something to sell.

**Risks:** B2B sales cycles in regulated industries run 30-90 days even for low-ticket items. A 4-6 week pre-launch window means first paying customers arrive 8-12 weeks after launch, not at launch. Plan financially for that lag.

**Revised position:** Acceptable tradeoff. Nudge the window to 6-8 weeks, not 4-6, because established organizations have procurement friction.

### Target Shift: Established Orgs Over Startups

This is the right call and the council should have weighted it more heavily initially. Established organizations have existing budgets, existing pain (SOPs that need updating), and existing relationships Evelyn can activate.

The subcontractor-to-client pipeline is particularly smart. She has worked inside these organizations. That is not a marketing angle — it is a sales advantage. The product practically pitches itself: "Remember how painful that SOP revision cycle was? I built a tool for that."

### QMSR as a Marketing Hook

The Feb 2 deadline weakens the urgency framing considerably. However, compliance remediation is permanent. The revised hook — "The deadline passed. Are your SOPs updated?" — works because the answer for most organizations is "no."

Do not build a campaign around QMSR alone. It belongs in the rotation as one of 3-4 pain-point themes alongside ISO 17025 accreditation prep, audit readiness, and regulatory submission documentation. One LinkedIn post on the post-deadline reality is worth doing. A series is not.

### Pricing Positioning

At $49 single / $159 bundle, established orgs will not buy singles. They will buy bundles and subscriptions. The $49 price point serves as low-friction entry for individual consultants and quality managers testing with their own money before requesting team budget. The real revenue line is the $199-$299 team monthly tier.

**Caution:** Do not let $49 become the anchor in messaging. Lead with bundle and team pricing. Position single SOPs as "try one first" rather than the default.

### Consulting-as-Funnel Strategy

This is Evelyn's strongest asymmetric advantage and the council undervalued it. The platform generates leads for consulting; consulting builds trust for subscriptions. Each reinforces the other.

Key execution detail: make consulting promotion contextual, not intrusive. After a user generates their third or fourth SOP, surface: "Need help implementing these across your QMS? Talk to our team." That feels like service, not sales.

### Updated Recommendations (Bandwidth-Realistic)

- **Now through launch:** 1 post/week on LinkedIn, rotating between regulatory pain points, behind-the-scenes product glimpses, and consulting thought leadership. No sales pitch until the product exists.
- **6-8 weeks pre-launch:** Shift one post per week to product-specific content. Show before-and-after SOP output. Let the work speak.
- **At launch:** Direct outreach to 20-30 contacts from professional network. Personalized messages, not mass email. These are warm leads.
- **Post-launch:** Let early customer results drive content. One case study is worth fifty thought leadership posts.

## 5. Business Risk & Financial Analyst

### Recalculated Unit Economics

The council's original $1,500/customer assumption was aspirational. Evelyn's correction to 3-5 SOPs per established org customer is grounded in how quality departments actually buy: they have most of their documentation, they need specific gaps filled or aging documents updated.

**One-time customer value:**
- Low end: 3 SOPs x $49 = $147
- Mid: 4 SOPs x $62 (blended) = $248
- Bundle buyer: $159-$239 (effectively $32-$48/SOP — discount but guaranteed volume)

**Subscription customer value (12-month retention):**
- Individual: $79-$119/month = $948-$1,428/year
- Team: $199-$299/month = $2,388-$3,588/year

If the 3:1 single-to-subscription ratio holds, a cohort of 20 customers looks like: 15 one-time buyers at ~$200 avg ($3,000) plus 5 subscribers at ~$100/month avg ($6,000/year). That is $9,000 from 20 customers in year one. For a bootstrap project with near-zero costs, the margins are extraordinary.

### Modified Go/No-Go Assessment

Evelyn's adjustment to 5-10 paying customers by month 3 and repeat purchases by month 6 is softer than the council's original 50+ customers / $8K MRR target, but matches the bootstrap reality: she is not burning runway, so she can afford patience.

The risk with soft criteria is psychological, not financial. Without a firm kill threshold, a product can limp along indefinitely consuming 10 hours/week. At $99-$199/hour consulting rates, that is real opportunity cost — conditional on consulting opportunities existing, which currently they do not. Reassess quarterly.

**Recommended hard floor:** If month 6 shows zero repeat purchases and zero referrals, that is a product-market fit failure regardless of customer count.

### Infrastructure Cost Advantage

Genuinely significant. At $30/month for Digital Ocean versus $500+/month for comparable SaaS tooling, breakeven drops to absurdly low levels. Two individual subscribers at $79/month cover all infrastructure costs with margin to spare. The custom build eliminates platform risk and creates a technical asset that appreciates over time.

### Realistic Revenue Projections

| Timeframe | Customers | Monthly Revenue |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Month 6 | 8-15 | $800-$2,500 |
| Month 12 | 25-40, 8-12 subscribers | $1,500-$4,500 |
| Month 18 | 50-80 (if referrals activate) | $3,000-$8,000 |

These numbers will not replace a salary. They could fund the operation, validate the market, and build toward meaningful side income.

### AI Competitive Threat — Revised

Evelyn's distinction between AI capability and AI usability is the strongest counterargument. Quality professionals are process-conservative by professional obligation. They will not paste regulatory requirements into ChatGPT and trust the output for audit-facing documents. The moat is expertise baked into software plus trust that it meets regulatory standards. This holds for 2-3 years. Beyond that, AI-assisted compliance tools narrow the gap, making the consulting add-on and customer relationships the durable assets.

### Top 3 Financial/Business Risks

1. **Customer acquisition cost uncertainty.** Established orgs buy through relationships, not landing pages. If it takes 20 hours of selling effort per customer at $200 average value, the implicit acquisition cost exceeds revenue.

2. **Subscription conversion dependency.** If the ratio flips to 5:1 single-to-sub instead of 3:1, annual revenue per 20-customer cohort drops from $9,000 to $5,400. Track this from day one.

3. **Time allocation drift.** Ten hours per week is a real constraint. If build runs long, or if support/sales/content consume the maintenance hours, the product stalls without a clear mechanism to recover momentum.

## Unified Recommendations & Next Steps

### The Council's Updated Top 10 Priorities

**IMMEDIATE (During Build Phase):**

1. **Complete QMSR content update for all 21 CFR 820 SOPs.** This is a launch blocker. Begin now, in parallel with build. (Regulatory Expert — unanimous)

2. **Validate content matrix completeness.** Before building assembly UI, confirm content blocks exist for every combo key the platform will offer. Seed scripts should fail loudly on gaps. (Product Architect)

3. **Define minimum launch catalog: 20 Core SOPs.** Do not launch subscriptions until this threshold is met. Sell singles below it. (SaaS Strategist)

4. **Add transactional email to the build plan.** Registration, purchase confirmation, download delivery all require it. Use Resend or SendGrid. (Product Architect)

**PRE-LAUNCH (6-8 Weeks Before):**

5. **Begin LinkedIn content — 1 post/week.** Rotate between regulatory pain points, behind-the-scenes product, and consulting thought leadership. No sales pitch until product exists. (Marketing)

6. **Consider pre-platform sales.** Manual fulfillment of single SOPs as static Word documents for early cash flow and customer validation. (SaaS Strategist)

7. **Build version/edition metadata into every document.** Regulation version, document version date, applicable edition. Cannot be retrofitted easily. (Regulatory Expert)

**AT LAUNCH:**

8. **Direct outreach to 20-30 warm contacts.** Personalized messages to professional network. These are relationship sales, not inbound leads. (Marketing)

9. **Lead with bundle and team pricing in messaging.** Position $49 single as "try one first," not the anchor. (Marketing, SaaS Strategist)

10. **Track two metrics above all others:** Individual-to-team conversion rate and repeat purchase rate. These determine whether this is side income or a real business. (SaaS Strategist, Risk Analyst)
