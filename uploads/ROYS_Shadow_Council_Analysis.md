## Council Overview

Five specialized expert perspectives were brought to bear on the ROYS Advisory Board Brief and Competitive Landscape Analysis:

| Council Member | Focus Area |
|---|---|
| **SaaS Business Strategist** | Pricing, subscription economics, go-to-market, competitive moat |
| **Regulatory Affairs & Quality Systems Expert** | Content depth, audit-readiness claims, regulatory credibility, standards expansion |
| **Product & Technology Architect** | Bubble.io assessment, data model, MVP features, output quality, scalability |
| **B2B Marketing & GTM Specialist** | Customer segmentation, content marketing, QMSR campaign, consultant channel |
| **Business Risk & Financial Analyst** | TAM sizing, unit economics, opportunity cost, competitive threat timeline, go/no-go criteria |

**Overall Consensus: ROYS addresses a genuine market gap with real domain expertise. The concept is strong. The execution plan needs sharpening — particularly around pricing (too low), platform choice (acceptable for MVP only), the "audit-ready" claim (needs reframing), and the QMSR timing window (must move fast).**

---

## Synthesized Key Findings

### What the Council Unanimously Agrees On

1. **The content library is the real asset.** 610 requirements, 539 mappings, 567 content blocks, 81 SOPs — this represents months of genuine domain expertise encoded into a structured, reusable system. This is the core IP.

2. **The requirement-to-SOP traceability mapping is the killer differentiator.** Every council member identified this as the single most valuable and unique feature. No competitor offers visible, granular regulatory clause-to-procedure traceability. Lead with this in every conversation, every demo, every piece of marketing.

3. **The pricing is too low.** All five perspectives converge on this: $49-$79 per SOP signals "template" rather than "expert-curated compliance system." The recommended range is $149-$299 for standard SOPs and $299-$449 for risk-integrated SOPs. At $200/hr consulting rates, even $299/SOP is a fraction of the alternative cost.

4. **The QMSR transition is a once-in-a-decade window.** Every council member flagged this as the most urgent strategic priority. The compliance deadline is NOW (February 2026). Speed to market matters more than feature completeness.

5. **Bubble.io is acceptable for MVP but plan the exit.** Use it to validate, close first customers, and prove the model. But maintain the content library independently from Bubble.io, and plan migration when revenue hits $5K-$8K MRR.

6. **The "audit-ready" claim needs reframing.** The regulatory expert was most forceful here: "audit-ready" implies the SOP can go straight to an auditor as-is, which it cannot without organization-specific customization. Reframe as "audit-aligned" or sell the "hardest 80% done" story — which is actually more compelling and more honest.

7. **Consultants are the golden distribution channel.** Quality/regulatory consultants who serve multiple clients are the highest-LTV segment and a force-multiplier for distribution. Build the consultant partner program early.

8. **The AI threat has a 12-18 month window.** Expert-curated content has a clear advantage today, but the gap narrows. By 2028, AI-generated compliance content will be "good enough" for many use cases. ROYS must build additional moats (brand trust, audit outcome data, regulatory update velocity, customer relationships) within this window.

### Where the Council Diverges

| Topic | Optimistic View | Cautious View |
|---|---|---|
| **Year 1 Revenue** | $75K-$150K achievable (Marketing, SaaS strategists) | $15K-$75K more realistic (Risk analyst) |
| **Launch Scope** | All 5 standards from day one (Product architect) | ISO 13485 only, expand after validation (Risk analyst) |
| **Subscription Model** | Viable with regulatory update framing (SaaS strategist) | May not justify recurring revenue as currently designed (Risk analyst) |
| **Risk-based content tier** | Smart premium differentiation (SaaS strategist) | Should be baseline, not premium — modern standards require it (Regulatory expert) |

---

## 1. SaaS Business Strategist

### Pricing Model: Raise Prices Significantly

The proposed $49-$79/SOP is underpriced relative to alternatives:
- Consultant: $1,500-$4,500 per SOP
- Medical Device Academy bundle: $500-$1,000+ per SOP (all-in with customization time)
- Internal quality engineer: $400-$2,000 per SOP in labor

**Recommended pricing:**
- **Pay-per-SOP (Standard):** $149-$249
- **Pay-per-SOP (Risk-Integrated):** $299-$449
- **Individual Subscription:** $299-$499/month (one standard family) or $799-$1,199/month (all standards)
- **Team Subscription:** $1,499-$2,499/month for 3-5 seats
- **Annual discounts:** 30-35% off monthly rates

**Critical warning:** Do NOT use the phrase "AI-polished" in the premium tier description. In regulated industries, "AI-polished" *reduces* perceived value. Position as "expert-reviewed, risk-analyzed content with regulatory traceability."

### Go-to-Market Priority Customers

1. **Tier 1:** Pre-submission medical device startups (Series A/B, 10-50 employees) — highest urgency
2. **Tier 2:** Contract research organizations and testing laboratories (GLP/ISO 17025)
3. **Tier 3:** Quality consultants themselves — highest LTV, become a distribution channel

### Subscription Justification Tactics

- Make pay-per-SOP deliberately inferior (static export only, no updates, no cross-referencing)
- Anchor subscription against regulatory risk, not template cost
- Build interconnection between SOPs (cross-references create library value)
- Offer annual commitment with 30-35% discount

### Competitive Moat Assessment

- **Year 1-2:** Strong position — AI cannot match regulatory precision yet
- **Year 2-3:** Narrowing gap — AI produces 60-70% quality
- **Year 3-5:** Commoditization risk — moat must shift to customer relationships, audit data, and update velocity

### Top 5 Actions (SaaS Strategist)
1. Validate pricing with 10-15 contacts before building features
2. Build the QMSR transition wedge campaign
3. Secure 5 beta customers with testimonial agreements
4. Launch LinkedIn content strategy immediately
5. Define "no-go" criteria now (before emotional investment clouds judgment)

---

## 2. Regulatory Affairs & Quality Systems Expert

### Content Library Assessment

610 requirements across 5 standards is credible for v1, but **EU MDR is the biggest gap.** EU MDR has 400+ requirements including annexes — if ROYS covers ~100-120, that's only 25-30% of the regulation. This is a credibility risk.

The 81 SOPs and 567 content blocks are reasonable. The 539 mappings covering 88% of requirements is defensible (remaining 12% likely informational/definitional).

### The "Audit-Ready" Claim — MUST Reframe

An auditor evaluates:
- **Adequacy** (does it address the requirement?) — ROYS delivers this ✓
- **Implementation evidence** — ROYS cannot deliver this ✗
- **Organization-specific context** — ROYS cannot deliver this ✗
- **Document control compliance** — ROYS cannot deliver this ✗

**Recommended language:** "ROYS eliminates the hardest 80% of the work — interpreting regulatory requirements and drafting compliant procedure language — so you can focus on the 20% that makes it yours."

This framing is more honest AND more compelling to experienced quality professionals.

### Requirement-to-SOP Mapping: Genuinely Valuable

Auditors appreciate traceability matrices. Quality managers rely on them during audits. The key is granularity — mapping must be at the sub-clause level (e.g., "ISO 13485 clause 7.5.6" not just "clause 7") to be useful.

### Multi-Standard Coverage: Market as Bundles, Not Breadth

Very few organizations need all 5 standards. Market as targeted combinations:
1. **Medical Device QMS Bundle:** ISO 13485 + 21 CFR 820/QMSR + EU MDR
2. **Laboratory Accreditation Bundle:** ISO 17025 (with optional GLP add-on)
3. **GLP Compliance Package:** 21 CFR 58 standalone

The harmonized SOP approach (one procedure satisfying multiple standards simultaneously) is extremely valuable and is what consultants charge $300-500/hr to develop.

### Risk-Based Content: Should Be Baseline, Not Premium

Modern standards (ISO 13485:2016, QMSR, ISO 17025:2017, EU MDR) all require risk-based thinking. An SOP without risk elements is arguably incomplete under current standards.

**Restructured tiers recommended:**
- **Core Tier ($79-$99/SOP):** Regulatory-complete content WITH risk-based elements as standard
- **Enhanced Tier ($129-$179/SOP):** Core + implementation guidance + example forms + cross-references

### Standards Expansion Roadmap (Priority Order)

**Tier 1 (Add within 6 months):**
- MDSAP (audit framework, high overlap with existing content)
- ISO 14971:2019 (Risk Management — companion to ISO 13485)

**Tier 2 (Add within 12 months):**
- ISO 15189:2022 (Clinical Laboratory — transition deadline Dec 2027 creates urgency)
- 21 CFR 210/211 (Pharmaceutical cGMP — massive market, requires pharma expertise)

**Do NOT add:** ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 27001 (not adjacent, different buyer)

### Regulatory Risks to Address
- **Customer misuse:** Strong ToS, customization prompts with placeholders in generated SOPs
- **ISO copyright:** Paraphrase requirement descriptions rather than quoting standard text verbatim
- **Content liability:** Professional liability insurance, clear terms establishing guidance (not regulatory advice)

### Top 5 Actions (Regulatory Expert)
1. Reframe "audit-ready" to "audit-aligned" / "the hardest 80% done"
2. Build QMSR transition campaign in next 90 days
3. Make risk-based content the baseline, not premium
4. Pursue MDSAP mapping and ISO 14971 SOPs as immediate expansions
5. Build the audit outcome feedback loop (which SOPs pass audits without findings)

## 3. Product & Technology Architect

### Bubble.io: Acceptable for MVP, Plan the Exit

**Pros:** Speed to market, no DevOps overhead, visual database modeling
**Cons:** B2B credibility in regulated industries, data sovereignty limits, no SOC 2 for your app, vendor lock-in, performance ceiling, document generation limitations

**Critical recommendation:** From day one, maintain the content library (requirements, mappings, content blocks) in a separate, portable format — a PostgreSQL database or structured JSON/CSV files in a Git repository. The Bubble.io app is the delivery mechanism, not the product.

**Migration trigger:** $5K-$8K MRR or first enterprise deal requiring SOC 2, whichever comes first. Budget $15K-$25K and 6-8 weeks for migration to a custom stack (Next.js + PostgreSQL + Vercel or similar).

### Data Model Recommendations

The schema should support:
- **Standard versioning** (active/superseded status, effective dates)
- **Standard combinations** (content blocks keyed to standard combos, not individual standards)
- **Content block versioning** (full audit trail for every edit — eat your own dog food)
- **Deterministic assembly logic** (simple lookup, not AI — same inputs = same output always)

### MVP Feature Prioritization

**MVP (Weeks 1-10):**
- Landing page, user registration, standard selection, SOP catalog
- Single SOP generation with Word (.docx) download
- Traceability table in the generated document
- Stripe payment (pay-per-SOP)
- Basic admin panel for content management

**v1.0 (Months 3-4):** Subscription tiers, PDF export, bundle purchasing, gap analysis view, user dashboard

**v1.5 (Months 5-7):** Team accounts, light customization (company name/logo), content update alerts

**v2.0 (Months 8-12):** API for eQMS integration, white-label for consultants, migration off Bubble.io

**Explicitly do NOT build:** Document management features, AI content generation, training management, audit scheduling

### Output Quality Is Everything

The generated Word document IS the product. If formatting looks amateur, nothing else matters. Invest in a professional document template. The traceability table appendix is the single most valuable artifact — make it prominent, accurate, and complete.

### Top 5 Actions (Product Architect)
1. Maintain knowledge graph independently from Bubble.io
2. Invest in document output quality before anything else
3. Price by value, not by cost (test $199-$299 for complex SOPs)
4. Build the gap analysis view early (most compelling UX)
5. Plan the Bubble.io exit before you enter

## 4. B2B Marketing & Go-to-Market Specialist

### Ideal Customer Profiles (Ranked)

| Segment | Acquisition Speed | LTV | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A: "Oh Shit, QMSR" MedDev Startups** | Fastest | Medium ($1,500-$4,000) | Launch with this |
| **B: Regulatory Consultants** | Medium | Highest ($5,000-$15,000/yr) | Build channel by month 3 |
| **C: Mid-Market Adding Standards** | Slowest | Medium-High ($3,000-$8,000) | Grows organically |

### QMSR Campaign — Execute Immediately

**Core message:** "Your existing SOPs were written for the old 21 CFR 820. The QMSR changed everything. Do you know which of your SOPs are now non-compliant?"

**Specific campaigns:**
1. **"QMSR SOP Gap Finder"** — Free interactive checklist, generates personalized gap report, captures qualified emails
2. **"QMSR Countdown" LinkedIn Series** — Weekly posts highlighting specific QMSR changes and SOP implications
3. **"Before and After" SOP Comparisons** — Literal before/after showing old 820 vs. QMSR language
4. **"QMSR Ready" Certification Badge** — Social proof for customers and consultants

### LinkedIn Strategy (Primary Channel — 60% of Effort)

- **Profile headline:** "I help FDA-regulated companies build audit-ready SOPs in days, not months"
- **3 posts/week:** Monday (regulatory insight), Wednesday (behind the build), Friday (practical tip)
- **Daily engagement:** Comment on 5-10 posts from quality/regulatory professionals
- **Connection strategy:** 10-15 targeted connections/day with personalized notes

### Consultant Partner Program

**Tier 1: Consultant License ($199-$399/month or $1,999-$3,999/year)**
- Full SOP library access, white-label customization, unlimited client deployments
- "ROYS Certified Partner" badge, priority support

**Tier 2: Referral Partner (Free)**
- 20-25% recurring commission on referred subscriptions
- 15-20% commission on one-time purchases

### Messaging — NEVER Use the Word "Template"

"Template" cheapens positioning. Use: "SOPs," "procedures," "documentation," "compliance system." Every time "template" appears in ROYS marketing, it invites price comparison to $897 Advisera bundles.

### Pre-Launch Strategy (Starting NOW)

- **Week 1-2:** Waitlist landing page + QMSR Gap Analysis Checklist (lead magnet)
- **Week 3-6:** LinkedIn content engine + recruit 10-15 beta testers + email newsletter
- **Week 7-10:** Announce launch date, early access for waitlist, prepare launch week content

### Top 5 Actions (Marketing)
1. Build waitlist + QMSR lead magnet (Week 1-2, $0-$19 cost)
2. LinkedIn content engine — 3x/week starting immediately
3. Recruit 10-15 beta testers from personal network
4. Publish 2-3 SEO blog posts targeting QMSR keywords
5. Design and soft-launch consultant partner program

## 5. Business Risk & Financial Analyst

### Market Sizing

- **TAM:** ~90,000-110,000 unique organizations globally (medical device, lab, GLP)
- **SAM:** ~15,000-25,000 English-speaking SMBs actively building/updating QMS
- **SOM (Year 1-3):** 50-200 customers Year 1, scaling to 500-1,000 by Year 3

**This is a niche B2B market. Not venture-scale. Can be an excellent lifestyle/bootstrap business at $500K-$1.5M ARR.**

### Unit Economics

At $75 avg per SOP, 20 SOPs per customer = $1,500 average per customer.

| Scenario | Customers | Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| Conservative Year 1 | 20-50 | $30K-$75K |
| Moderate Year 1 | 50-100 | $75K-$150K |
| Optimistic Year 1 | 100-200 | $150K-$300K |

Bubble.io costs are modest (<5% of revenue at 50+ customers). Cash break-even is easy.

### Opportunity Cost — The Hidden Tax

At $200/hr consulting, 10 hrs/week on ROYS = **$8,000/month opportunity cost.** True break-even (including opportunity cost): ~$8,500/month revenue, or ~57 subscribers at $149/month. Timeline: 12-18 months post-launch.

### Competitive Threat Timeline

| Horizon | Threat Level | Reality |
|---|---|---|
| 6 months | LOW | AI cannot match regulatory precision. Window is open. |
| 12 months | MODERATE | 2-3 AI compliance startups emerge. eQMS vendors market AI features. |
| 24 months | HIGH | AI produces "good enough" first-draft SOPs. Expert advantage diminishes. |
| 36 months | SEVERE | AI compliance content is table stakes. Moat must come from elsewhere. |

### Go/No-Go Framework

**GREEN (Invest More):** 50+ customers, $8K+ MRR by month 6, NPS 40+, customers referencing SOPs in actual audits

**YELLOW (Keep Iterating):** 15-49 customers, $2K-$8K MRR, growth but slow, pricing pushback

**RED (Pause/Pivot):** <15 customers, <$2K MRR, "ChatGPT does this" feedback, no repeat purchases

### The Hard Questions

1. **SaaS vs. consulting deliverable?** The SaaS only wins when revenue decouples from time. Until ~$15K MRR, consulting generates more per hour of Evelyn's time.

2. **Subscription justification?** Once a company has its 15-30 SOPs, the subscription must earn its keep through regulatory updates, new standards, and compliance monitoring. This needs more development.

3. **Consider a hybrid model:** "Consulting-assisted SaaS" — software generates first draft, Evelyn reviews for premium, pure self-serve at lower tier. This hedges risk and validates demand.

### Top 5 Actions (Risk Analyst)
1. Pre-sell before you build — target 10 pre-sales or reassess
2. Launch with ONE standard (ISO 13485), not five
3. Set a financial kill switch ($5,000 cumulative revenue by month 6 or pause)
4. Separate content from platform (portable format outside Bubble.io)
5. Test consulting + SaaS hybrid model with next 3-5 consulting clients

## Unified Recommendations & Next Steps

### The Council's Top 10 Priorities (Synthesized & Ranked)

**IMMEDIATE (Next 2 Weeks):**

1. **Reframe the "audit-ready" claim.** Adopt "audit-aligned" or "the hardest 80% done" language. This is more honest AND more compelling. (Regulatory Expert, unanimous support)

2. **Raise the prices.** $149-$249 for standard SOPs, $299-$449 for enhanced. The current pricing signals "template" not "expert system." (All 5 council members)

3. **Build the waitlist + QMSR Gap Analysis lead magnet.** The window is NOW. Start capturing demand before the MVP is ready. (Marketing, SaaS strategist)

4. **Start LinkedIn content — 3x/week.** Don't wait for the product. Build the audience and authority now. (Marketing, SaaS strategist)

**SHORT-TERM (Weeks 3-8):**

5. **Maintain content library independently from Bubble.io.** Store the knowledge graph (requirements, mappings, content blocks) in a portable format you control. This is your IP insurance. (Product architect, Risk analyst)

6. **Recruit 10-15 beta testers with testimonial commitments.** In regulated industries, peer proof is the primary purchase driver. (Marketing, SaaS strategist)

7. **Restructure pricing tiers.** Risk-based content should be baseline (modern standards require it). Premium tier should be implementation guidance + forms + cross-references. (Regulatory expert)

8. **Market as standard-specific bundles, not "all 5 standards."** Medical Device QMS Bundle, Lab Accreditation Bundle, GLP Package. (Regulatory expert, Marketing)

**PRE-LAUNCH (Weeks 8-12):**

9. **Invest heavily in document output quality.** The generated Word doc IS the product. Professional formatting, clean traceability tables, proper headers/footers. Test with 3-5 quality managers: "Would you bring this to an FDA audit?" (Product architect)

10. **Define go/no-go criteria before launch.** GREEN: 50+ customers, $8K MRR by month 6. RED: <15 customers, <$2K MRR. Write it down and commit. (Risk analyst)

### The Strategic Narrative

ROYS sits at a rare intersection: genuine domain expertise + a clear market gap + perfect regulatory timing (QMSR). The content library is built. The competitive landscape shows no one doing what ROYS does. The QMSR transition creates urgency that no amount of marketing could manufacture.

The central risk is not the market or the product — it's execution speed. Every month of delay narrows the QMSR window, gives AI tools time to improve, and gives eQMS platforms time to add content generation. Move fast, stay focused, and let the expertise speak.

## Questions for Evelyn

The council identified several areas where Evelyn's input would sharpen the strategy. These are for your conversation later today:

### Pricing & Business Model
1. **What do your current consulting clients pay for SOP documentation work?** (Helps calibrate pricing against the alternative she's directly replacing)
2. **Would you consider a "consulting-assisted SaaS" hybrid** — software generates the draft, you review/customize for a premium fee? This hedges the self-serve risk.
3. **How many hours per week can you realistically commit to ROYS** alongside your consulting practice? (Critical for setting realistic timelines)
4. **Is there an appetite for a co-founder or technical partner** to share the execution burden?

### Content & Regulatory
5. **How deep is the EU MDR coverage currently?** The council flagged this as potentially only 25-30% of the regulation. Is that accurate?
6. **Are requirement descriptions paraphrased or quoted from ISO standards?** (Copyright risk with ISO/IEC standards)
7. **What's the plan for content maintenance** when regulations update? Is this a monthly task, quarterly, ad-hoc?
8. **Has any ROYS-generated SOP been used in an actual audit yet?** Even informally through consulting work?

### Market & Customers
9. **How large is your current professional network** of quality managers and consultants? (This is the launch audience)
10. **Who are the 5 people you'd call first** to beta test? (Start there)
11. **Are any consulting clients currently struggling with the QMSR transition?** They might be the perfect first customers.
12. **What's your take on the consultant channel?** Would your peer consultants see ROYS as a tool or a threat?

### Technical
13. **Have you started the Bubble.io build yet?** How far along is it?
14. **What does a generated SOP look like right now?** Is there a sample we can review?
15. **Is there a technical development resource identified** for the Bubble.io work, or is that still being arranged?
