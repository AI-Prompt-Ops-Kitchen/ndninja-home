# 2026-02-05 — Session Log

## Content Pipeline — Gaming & Tech Videos
- Ran discovery for gaming, AI, and tech categories
- Generated 4 videos: GitHub Agents, Anthropic Ad-Free, Steam Machine Delayed, Microsoft/Fancy Bear
- Scheduled publishing:
  - Wed 2/5 9AM: Ashes of Creation (published ✅)
  - Wed 2/5 3PM: Anthropic Ad-Free
  - Fri 2/7 9AM: Microsoft/Fancy Bear (v3 pending — needs Kling re-run)
  - Fri 2/7 3PM: Steam Machine Delayed
  - Sat 2/8 9AM: GitHub Codex + Claude

## Pipeline Improvements Made
- **TTS stability**: 0.5 → 0.65, style 0.3 → 0.4 (more consistent pacing)
- **Silence trimming**: Added auto-trim for pauses >0.6s → capped at 0.3s
- **Kling-only rule**: Removed Veo fallback. Pipeline aborts if Kling fails (no more looping Veo clips)
- **Thumbnail topic icons**: Added `_detect_topic_icons()` to ninja_thumbnail.py — auto-detects keywords and adds relevant visual icons to thumbnail prompts
- **Standard intro/outro** added to ninja_scriptgen.py:
  - Intro: "What's up my fellow Ninjas, this is Neurodivergent Ninja here back with another video."
  - Outro: "Thanks for making it this far in the video, it would really help out the channel if you could please like, follow and subscribe as it will really help this channel grow. Peace out fellow ninjas, I'll see you in the next video!"
- Scripts should be written as ONE continuous paragraph (no paragraph breaks = no TTS pauses)

## Security Hardening
- **Redis**: Bound to localhost, strong password set (saved in `.redis_password`)
- **UFW firewall**: Enabled, default deny incoming, Tailscale + SSH allowed
- **PostgreSQL**: Bound to localhost (was `*`)
- **Samba**: Bound to localhost (was `0.0.0.0`)
- **Git history scrubbed**: Removed client_secrets.json + large binaries from git history (454MB → 9.5MB repo)
- **New Google API key**: Old one flagged as leaked. Created fresh key, saved in `.env.google_api`
- **Hardcoded keys removed**: ninja_content.py and ninja_thumbnail.py now use env vars only
- **.gitignore updated**: client_secrets.json, youtube_oauth.json, .redis_password, .env.google_api

## Electron Skill
- Installed electron-dev skill from Electron repo's CLAUDE.md → `~/clawd/skills/electron-dev/SKILL.md`

## Prompt Toolkit SaaS Project
- Shadow Council produced: BUSINESS_PLAN.md, PRODUCT_DESIGN.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Positioning**: "Prompt IDE" — teach to fish, not sell fish. $9/mo Pro tier.
- **Standout features**: Prompt DNA (visual breakdown), Prompt Lab (A/B testing), Prompt Remix (fork/remix)
- **Stack**: Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Supabase + Capacitor + Vercel
- **UI Design Engineer** rebuilt all 10 pages with shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, dark mode cyberpunk aesthetic
- Builds clean, screenshots taken and sent
- Project at: `~/clawd/projects/prompt-toolkit/`

## Microsoft Video — Current Status
- Script v3 written with new intro/outro format, awaiting user approval before Kling run
- Script at: `/tmp/script_microsoft_hackers_v3.txt`
- User wants to review and potentially edit before running
