## 🎭 MAJOR: Helmet Design Solves Lip-Sync Problem!

After many failed attempts with the masked ninja (mouth kept bleeding through), user found the solution: **full helmet design**.

**New Reference Image:** `assets/reference/ninja_helmet.jpg`
- Cyber ninja with full face helmet + glowing blue visor
- Same armor/aesthetic, just full face coverage
- NO visible face = AI can't hallucinate a mouth
- Works with FULL lip-sync enabled (natural gestures, body language)

**Tested successfully:**
- Short clip (~5s) ✅
- Longer clip (~12s) ✅
- Full lip-sync with real audio ✅

**This is the production solution going forward.**

## Failed Approaches (For Reference)

Tried many things with the original masked ninja that DIDN'T work:
1. `--motion` mode (Kling i2v) — mouth still appeared
2. Strong negative prompts — inconsistent results
3. Texture edits to mask — didn't help
4. Ken Burns effect — user didn't like (too static)
5. Mask overlay composite — visible seam line
6. Silent Avatar + audio overlay — worked but no arm gestures

## Scripts Created

- `scripts/ninja_motion.py` — Kling i2v motion (superseded by helmet solution)
- `scripts/ninja_kenburns.py` — Ken Burns effect
- `scripts/ninja_mask_fix.py` — Composite overlay
- `scripts/ninja_avatar_silent.py` — Silent Avatar approach

## Video Pipeline Status

**Scheduled videos (need regeneration with helmet):**
- Fri 2/7 9AM: Microsoft/Fancy Bear
- Fri 2/7 3PM: Steam Machine Delayed
- Sat 2/8 9AM: GitHub Codex + Claude

## TTS Settings (UPDATED)

**New Production Stack:**
- Voice: `Neurodivergent Ninja Remix` (ID: `aQspKon0UdKOuBZQQrEE`)
- Model: `eleven_v3` (works with remix, NOT with original PVC)
- Settings: stability=0.5, similarity_boost=0.75, style=0.4
- Captions: Character-level timestamps from ElevenLabs API (perfect sync)

**Old setup (deprecated):**
- Voice ID: `pDrEFcc78kuc76ECGkU8` (original PVC - incompatible with V3)

## Helmet v2 Design

User updated artwork to replace exposed fingers with full tech ninja gloves:
- **File:** `assets/reference/ninja_helmet_v2.jpg` (small original)
- **Upscaled:** `assets/reference/ninja_helmet_v2_upscaled.jpg` (1080x1920, use this)
- Glowing blue circuit patterns on gloves match visor aesthetic
- Fully cohesive futuristic look

## Key Learnings

- ElevenLabs V3 works with "generated" category voices (remixes, instant clones)
- ElevenLabs V3 does NOT work with Professional Voice Clones (PVC)
- The Remix voice sounds more natural/flowing than original
- Small images (295x512) fail on fal.ai — upscale to 1080x1920 first
- User prefers unique voice over generic — remix satisfies this
