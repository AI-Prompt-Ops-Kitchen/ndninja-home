# 2026-01-31 Session Notes

## WhatsApp Setup for Partner ✅

### What Happened
- Set up Clawdbot WhatsApp link for someone else ("she")
- Used phone number linking (pairing code method)
- Initial issues: Clawd kept regenerating QR codes instead of accepting the pairing code
- User had to paste pairing code multiple times
- Eventually linked after restart (error code 515 → credentials saved → reconnected)

### How It Works
- She messages **herself** (her own phone number) to talk to Clawdbot
- Same method the owner uses

### Mistakes Made (For Future Reference)
1. **Compaction hit mid-session** - Lost context, had to ask user to re-explain
2. **QR code confusion** - User was using regular camera, not WhatsApp's QR scanner
3. **Kept regenerating codes** - Should have accepted the pairing code being sent
4. **Didn't write to daily log** - Would have prevented context loss

### Lesson Learned
**ALWAYS write critical session context to daily log DURING the conversation, not after.**
The compaction safety system only works if we actually USE it.

## TODO
- [ ] Improve compaction detection to auto-save more aggressively
- [ ] Add a pre-compaction hook that forces context save
