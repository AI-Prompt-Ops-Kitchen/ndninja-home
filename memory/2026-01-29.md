## 🎯 Main Work: Ninja Content Pipeline B-Roll

### Fixes Applied
- **Audio distortion fix**: Compositor was mixing segments WITH and WITHOUT audio, causing glitches. Fixed by keeping original audio as WAV (lossless), stripping audio from ALL video segments, then cleanly re-attaching at the end
- **B-roll prompts**: Added "no text, no logos, no writing" to ALL prompts - Veo was generating gibberish text
- **Clip count**: Changed default from 3 to 4 B-roll clips
- **Freeze detection**: Compositor now detects freeze frames in main video and places B-roll at those points

### New Scripts Created
- `scripts/local_broll_setup.py` — Setup CogVideoX/SVD on local GPU
- `scripts/ninja_broll_local.py` — Generate B-roll locally with RTX 4090

### Test Videos
- Samsung HBM4 script used for testing
- v1: B-roll had text/logos
- v2: Audio distorted
- v3: Should be fixed (sent for review)

## 🏆 THE GOLDEN RULE (Established & Codified)
> **"If you CAN do it, you SHOULD do it."**
> No delegation when you have the tools. Act first, report results.

Added to AGENTS.md and memory/PINNED.md as non-negotiable.

## 🔧 In Progress
- Setting up remote access to user's RTX 4090 machine
- Need: hostname/IP, SSH access
- Goal: Trigger local GPU generation from this server

## 📋 Open Items
- `clawd-dos`: Local B-roll generation with RTX 4090 (task created)
- Awaiting feedback on v3 audio quality
- YouTube upload integration still pending
