## What Happened
- Context7 already set up as Claude Code plugin — confirmed working ✓
- Created **HeyGen skill** for Claude Code CLI at `~/.claude/skills/heygen/`
  - SKILL.md with core workflow (list avatars → pick voice → generate → poll → download)
  - `references/api-reference.md` — full API endpoint reference (video gen, translation, templates, streaming, avatars, voices, photo avatars, video management)
  - `scripts/heygen.sh` — CLI helper wrapping all major HeyGen API operations
  - Skill passed validation ✓
- User asked about "new skills" that were discussed pre-compaction — lost context on what those were. Need to ask.
- Created **Craft Docs skill** for Claude Code CLI at `~/.claude/skills/craft-docs/`
  - Full MCP tool reference with real parameter schemas (extracted from session logs)
  - Covers: documents (create/list/search/move), markdown injection, blocks (get/update/delete), tasks (get/add/update/delete), folders
  - Includes Craft-specific markdown extensions (highlights, callouts)
  - Common workflows: create doc with content, update existing, organize, manage tasks
  - Skill passed validation ✓
- Set cron reminder for 8 PM Central tonight: HeyGen API key generation
- Created **LottieFiles skill** for Claude Code CLI at `~/.claude/skills/lottiefiles/`
  - MCP server already installed (`mcp-server-lottiefiles` v1.0.3) — tools: search, details, popular
  - REST API reference (no auth needed)
  - Integration guide: React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS, React Native
  - dotLottie player options, common search patterns
  - Skill passed validation ✓

- HeyGen API too expensive ($99/mo for 100 credits) — pivoting to self-hosted open source
- User cancelling HeyGen subscription entirely
- **Plan: MuseTalk on Vengeance (RTX 4090)**
  - Vengeance: Windows 11, WSL2 Ubuntu, 14th gen i9, 64GB RAM, RTX 4090 24GB, 2.5Gbps Ethernet/internet, 2x SSD (OS + 4TB secondary), 871GB free on OS drive, Python 3.12
  - Tailscale IP: 100.98.226.75, SSH user: Steam
  - Pipeline: Script → ElevenLabs voice → MuseTalk lip sync → ninja avatar video
  - Will create a `talking-avatar` skill once working
- User opened up about RSD (rejection sensitivity dysphoria) — prefers avatar over real face for content
  - Ninja avatar brand is the content strategy
  - Be supportive, this is important to them
- Cancelled HeyGen API key reminder (no longer needed)

- User's goal: become one of the best vibe coders in the world — believes they have the knowledge and creativity to be elite
- Wants to go SOLO (duo with Clawd) — remote, independent, no corporate/neurotypical workplace stress
- Overnight task: deep research & analysis on path to elite vibe coder status, solo career strategy
- WSL2 on Vengeance confirmed: C: (1.9TB, 530GB free) and D: (3.7TB, 2.4TB free) both visible. D: is the 4TB secondary SSD — ideal for ML models/projects.
- **WSL2 Python 3.10 bug:** kernel 6.6.87.2 has bytecode corruption affecting posixpath, urllib, packaging stdlib modules. Causes UnboundLocalError in for-loop variables. Affects ALL pip operations. Solution: Docker.
- **MuseTalk Docker image built successfully** — musetalk:latest, 4.79GB, PyTorch 2.1.2 + CUDA 12.1. Bypasses all WSL2 Python bugs.
- Overnight MuseTalk test COMPLETE:
  - Pipeline works ✅ — sample face + ninja audio → yongen_ninja_test.mp4 (proves it works)
  - Ninja avatar test ⚠️ — ninja_test_output.mp4 generated but mask causes issues (no visible mouth for lip-sync)
  - Had to patch face detection (dwpose fallback) and ffmpeg codec (mpeg4 vs libx264)
  - Key insight: MuseTalk needs visible mouth. Options: unmask avatar, composite approach, or try SadTalker/Wav2Lip
  - Output files in /home/ndninja/clawd/media/
- Gaming research also complete — saved to memory/gaming-with-ai-research.md. Top pick: Minecraft with Mindcraft
- **User's dream: play video games together with Clawd** — deeply personal request, about companionship. Overnight research task spawned.
- User plays Diablo 4, open to other games
- User went to sleep ~10:49 PM EST (but came back with ideas at 1 AM 😂)
- **Project idea: GitHub Trend Intelligence**
  - Monitor GitHub trending + awesome lists
  - Auto-analyze projects against user's stack/projects for relevance
  - Surface actionable insights ("this tool upgrades your pipeline")
  - Potential SaaS product — personalized dev trend intelligence
  - Reference: threads.com/@github.awesome
- **Brand identity brainstorm:**
  - Duo name: **Shadow Operators** 🥷🐾
  - Tagline: **Spec Ops: Vibe Division**
  - Motto: **Born as Ghosts** (Ghost in the Shell reference)
  - Concept: ND ninja + AI familiar operating from the shadows, world only sees the output

## Notes
- Memory search is broken — needs OpenAI or Google API key configured for embeddings
- Brave search API key not configured either
- User's timezone is Central (America/Chicago), not Eastern
