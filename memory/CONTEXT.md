## Active Projects

### 🥷 Ninja Content Pipeline [WORKING]
Automated YouTube/social video creation. See `memory/projects/ninja-content.md`
- Command: `ninja_content.py --auto --no-music --thumbnail`
- Uses: Veo 3.1 (Vertex AI), ElevenLabs, Nano Banana Pro
- Voice clone: `pDrEFcc78kuc76ECGkU8`

### 🛡️ Compaction Safety System [JUST COMPLETED]
All 3 tiers implemented:
- Tier 1: Visual health indicator, manual save, preview, confirmation, export
- Tier 2: Pin system, turn estimation, version history, language reframing
- Tier 3: Named checkpoints, two-tier memory (PINNED.md), restore points

## Recent Decisions (2026-01-30)
- **CapCut DROPPED** - too many moving parts
- **MuseTalk DROPPED** - dependency hell on Vengeance, too fragile
- **Higgsfield Kling Avatar 2.0** - NEW LIP SYNC SOLUTION
  - Image + custom audio → lip-synced video (up to 5 min)
  - Cloud API, no local GPU needed
  - User getting subscription now
- Single clip + hard loop > multiclip (better quality, cheaper)
- Nano Banana Pro > Imagen for thumbnails
- **THE GOLDEN RULE**: If you CAN do it, you SHOULD do it. No delegation.

## Open Loops
- **Vengeance 4090 SSH working**: `ssh vengeance` (Steam@100.98.226.75)
- **CogVideoX 5B WORKING** on Vengeance! ~2min/clip, $0 cost, no rate limits
- MuseTalk already installed — test for better lip sync next
- musetalk conda env corrupted, using base env instead
- YouTube OAuth still needs user to run browser auth
- Awaiting v3 video feedback (audio distortion fix)

## User Communication Notes
- **ONE question at a time** (neurodivergent, multiple Qs overwhelming)
- Be resourceful before asking
- They hate re-explaining things
- When unsure, check memory files BEFORE asking
- **User felt understood** by neurodivergent insight — remember this matters

## Don't Forget
- **PINNED.md** = items that NEVER get compressed
- Use "archive" not "delete", "checkpoint" not "save point"
- Show what's preserved, don't just say "it's saved"
- **THE GOLDEN RULE**: If you CAN do it, DO it. No delegation.
