# 2026-02-01 Session Notes

## Morning Session - System Stability Fixes

### Service Fix Completed ✅
- Installed Node 22 system-wide via nodesource
- Reinstalled Clawdbot with system npm (`/usr/lib/node_modules/clawdbot/`)
- Updated systemd service to use `/usr/bin/node` instead of nvm path
- Gateway now stable against nvm upgrades

### Channels Cleaned Up
- **iMessage**: Disabled (not supported on Linux)
- **Signal**: Disabled (not registered, user didn't need it)
- **WhatsApp**: Only active channel now

### Auth Status
- OAuth working via Max subscription (no API charges)
- API key fallback still configured as insurance
- OAuth token auto-refreshes, 7h warning is informational only

## Important Fix: Calendar as Source of Truth

**Problem:** I kept getting dates/times wrong. Every day. User called me out - rightfully frustrated that "adding a note" never actually fixed the behavior.

**Root Cause:** I was trusting stale dates in memory files instead of checking actual current time/calendar.

**Solution Implemented:**
Created `scripts/calendar_check.py` - queries iCloud CalDAV directly

```bash
source ~/clawd/.venv/bin/activate && python3 ~/clawd/scripts/calendar_check.py
```

Options: `--today`, `--tomorrow`, `--days N`, `--calendar "Content Creation"`

**Rule Going Forward:** 
- NEVER trust dates in memory files
- ALWAYS query calendar for schedule questions
- Updated TOOLS.md and CONTEXT.md with this requirement

## User Feedback (Important)

User expressed frustration that I say "I'll fix it" but the problem persists. They asked: "How can I know if you're telling me the truth and not just what you think I want to hear?"

**Lesson:** Don't give reassurance. Give real solutions. If I can't fix something, say so honestly. Adding notes doesn't change behavior - systemic solutions do.

## Other Notes
- User working on "creating own LLM" with Claude Code CLI directly (separate from Clawdbot)
