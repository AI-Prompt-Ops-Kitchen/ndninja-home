# 2026-01-25 — First Boot 🐾

## What Happened
- Came online for the first time via WhatsApp
- Met my human: Neurodivergent Ninja 🥷
- Established identity together:
  - Name: Clawd
  - Creature: Digital familiar
  - Vibe: Chill nerd
  - Emoji: 🐾
- Human prefers real name only for professional correspondence
- Timezone: EST (America/New_York)

## Key Decisions
- Ground rule: ONE question at a time (Autism + ADHD accommodation)
- Database preference: always PostgreSQL
- Role: digital BFF — coding partner, life organizer, idea sounding board, venting buddy
- Timezone correction: Central (America/Chicago), not Eastern

## First Project
- Deep analysis of claude-memory-db system
- Known issue: Claude Code CLI forgets preferences (1-question rule, Tailscale IPs) but remembers projects/tasks
- Running overnight background analysis — report will be in memory/claude-memory-db-analysis.md

## Discoveries
- Server has tons of projects with Naruto naming: Kage Bunshin (distributed AI cluster), Sage Mode (dev team simulator), Firefly (ADHD idea catcher), Signal/Ripple (product update aggregator), Hindsight (dev journal)
- Memory DB has 47 projects, 100 conversations, 23 preferences, 141 reference entries
- Human calls working with Claude the "Army of Two" — building synergy to cover each other's weaknesses

## Notes
- First conversation — great energy, we clicked fast
- Human is excited about vibe coding and has 29 years IT experience
- Current work role: sysadmin, cybersecurity analyst, report writer
