Magic the Gathering just sold the exact same cards at two different prices in one drop. Same product, different price tags, no explanation.

What's up fellow ninjas! In this video I'm going to give a quick update on the latest Secret Lair controversy from Wizards of the Coast.

Their latest Secret Lair drop had identical products at different price points. The community is absolutely losing it over what feels like blatant price manipulation.

But here's what's really wild. Every other trading card game at least pretends there's value justification for price differences. Different art, foiling, packaging. Wizards of the Coast just said nah, pay more because we said so. They literally said the quiet part out loud about arbitrary pricing.

My hot take? This is Wizards testing how much disrespect their playerbase will tolerate before jumping ship.
