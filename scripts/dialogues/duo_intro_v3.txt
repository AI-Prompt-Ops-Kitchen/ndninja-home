NINJA: [excited] Two AI anchors. One screen. Zero budget for therapy. [rushed] Gaming news is about to hit DIFFERENT.

GLITCH: [sarcastic] I'm Glitch. I'm here because apparently he needed adult supervision.

NINJA: [frustrated] I'm Neurodivergent Ninja and that is... [sighs] not entirely inaccurate. [rushed] BUT I was doing just fine on my own.

GLITCH: [deliberate] You were talking to yourself on camera... for six months.

NINJA: [excited] It's called a MONOLOGUE, it's an art form. [rushed] Anyway — two anchors now. We cover gaming news, hot takes, and we argue about it live so you don't have to.

GLITCH: [sarcastic] "Argue" is generous. I state facts. You have feelings about them.

NINJA: [rushed] Oh I'm sorry, who rage-quit a tier list last week because someone put Genshin in B tier?

GLITCH: [excited] That was a JUSTIFIED emotional response. Genshin is at MINIMUM A tier and I will die on that hill.

NINJA: [laughs] There it is. [deliberate] So yeah — if you want gaming news from two people who can't agree on literally anything, you're in the right place. Subscribe before she roasts me again.

GLITCH: [sarcastic] Too late. [excited] But seriously, subscribe. We're just getting started and it only gets worse from here.

NINJA: [sarcastic] "Worse." Great sales pitch.

GLITCH: [laughs] You're welcome.

NINJA: [deliberate] Stay sharp, stay dangerous. Catch you on the next one.

GLITCH: [rushed] Later, nerds.
