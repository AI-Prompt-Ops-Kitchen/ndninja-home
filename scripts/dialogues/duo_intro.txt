NINJA: Gaming news is about to hit different. I'm Neurodivergent Ninja, and I finally got backup.

GLITCH: What's up everyone, I'm Glitch. I'm basically his tech support... except I actually know what I'm talking about.

NINJA: Okay wow, we are TEN seconds in and she's already coming for me.

GLITCH: I'm just setting expectations. So here's the deal — two anchors, two perspectives, zero filter. We're breaking down the biggest gaming news every week, and we're not reading teleprompters.

NINJA: She's right though. If a game drops and it's fire, we'll tell you. If a company does something shady, we'll tell you that too. No sponsors pulling the strings.

GLITCH: And if Ninja has a bad take, I will be here in real time to let him know.

NINJA: See, this is why I worked solo for so long.

GLITCH: And look how that turned out. You needed me.

NINJA: I... okay fine. She's not wrong. So if you're into gaming news with actual personality, hit that subscribe. This is Ninja News Network now.

GLITCH: We're calling it that?

NINJA: We're calling it that. Stay sharp, stay dangerous. Catch you on the next one.

GLITCH: Later, nerds.
