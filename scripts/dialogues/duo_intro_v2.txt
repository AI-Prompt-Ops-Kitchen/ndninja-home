NINJA: Two AI anchors. One screen. Zero budget for therapy. Gaming news is about to hit different.

GLITCH: I'm Glitch. I'm here because apparently he needed adult supervision.

NINJA: I'm Neurodivergent Ninja and that is... not entirely inaccurate. BUT I was doing just fine on my own.

GLITCH: You were talking to yourself on camera for six months.

NINJA: It's called a MONOLOGUE, it's an art form. Anyway — two anchors now. We cover gaming news, hot takes, and we argue about it live so you don't have to.

GLITCH: "Argue" is generous. I state facts. You have feelings about them.

NINJA: Oh I'm sorry, who rage-quit a tier list last week because someone put Genshin in B tier?

GLITCH: That was a JUSTIFIED emotional response. Genshin is at MINIMUM A tier and I will die on that hill.

NINJA: There it is. So yeah — if you want gaming news from two people who can't agree on literally anything, you're in the right place. Subscribe before she roasts me again.

GLITCH: Too late. But seriously, subscribe. We're just getting started and it only gets worse from here.

NINJA: "Worse." Great sales pitch.

GLITCH: You're welcome.

NINJA: Stay sharp, stay dangerous. Catch you on the next one.

GLITCH: Later, nerds.
