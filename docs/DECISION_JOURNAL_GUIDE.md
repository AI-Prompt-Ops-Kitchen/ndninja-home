# Decision Journal User Guide

## What Is Decision Journal?

Decision Journal is a write-first, think-later system for capturing technical decisions during hyperfocus without breaking flow state.

No forms. No interruptions. Just capture decisions as you make them.

## Why This Exists

**ADHD Reality:** Hyperfocus is magical but fragile. Brilliant ideas that weren't written down vanish completely.

Decision Journal captures decisions silently while you stay in flow.

## How to Use It

```

Hit save. Stay in flow.

### After Hyperfocus (Review)

Review captured decisions:
```
✓ Use Redis for session caching (95%)

```
